          I am a seasoned statistician with <strong>over 14 years of 
          experience</strong> in experimental statistics and statistical 
          modelling. 
          I also specialise in the <strong>development of economic and 
          sustainability selection indices</strong> to support breeding and 
          systems optimisation.
          
          My research interests include <strong>statistical modelling</strong>,
          <strong>selection indeces</strong>,
          <strong>agriculture</strong>, <strong>genetics</strong>, and sports.
          
          Currently, I am <strong>Consultant Statistician at 
          <a href="https://www.abacusbio.com/">AbacusBio</a></strong>, 
          where I leverage my expertise in statistical methods and data 
          analysis to drive impactful research and innovative solutions. 
  
          My career has been marked by the application of both qualitative 
          and quantitative methods to explore the role of science and technology 
          across various sectors.

          I am passionate about using data to uncover insights and support 
          decision‑making. Whether it is improving agricultural outcomes or 
          enhancing athletic performance, my goal is to apply rigorous 
          statistical techniques to solve real‑world problems.

          Please review my publications and 
          get in touch if you are interested in 
          collaboration or have any enquiries.

          <p>My work focuses on advanced statistical modelling, the development of <strong>economic and sustainability selection indices</strong>, interactive dashboards, and reproducible pipelines (Docker), delivering decision‑ready insights in agriculture and sports performance.</p>

          <h3>Areas of impact:</h3>
          <ul>
          <li><strong>Agriculture:</strong> Designed and analysed agronomic and farm‑systems experiments, including multi‑environment trials and spatial models, to <em>optimise</em> yield, resource use, and sustainability.</li>
          <li><strong>Genetics:</strong> Built genetic evaluation pipelines and <em>economic and sustainability selection indices</em> to maximise genetic gain and inform breeding objectives.</li>
          <li><strong>Sports analytics:</strong> Developed tools and applications that enhance athlete performance through data‑driven insights.</li>
          </ul>
