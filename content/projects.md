          I lead and contribute to projects that translate rigorous statistical methods into decision‑ready insights. My portfolio spans statistical modelling, agriculture, genetics and sports analytics, with outputs ranging from spatial and longitudinal models to genetic evaluation pipelines, economic and sustainability selection indices, and decision‑support dashboards. The projects below illustrate this breadth and the impact delivered with industry and academic partners.
