# Summary

Measuring color hue in 'Sunrise Solo' papaya using a flatbed scanner

---

## Papaya Production

- Global papaya producing (FAO, 2012):

    - India: 38.61% (4,713,800)
    - Brazil: 17.5% (1,871,300)
    - Indonesia: 6.86% (695,214)
    
- Brazil: $2^{\circ}$ major papaya exporting (11.2\% of global trade)

- Papayas are classified according to size and color;

## Colorimeter Methodology

- Very efficient when the fruit has uniform coloration

- It may be inefficient when the fruit does not have uniform coloration

- Usually, samples are observed on the equatorial region of fruits

---

## Colorimeter Methodology

- The sample is observed from a very small area on the fruit's peel

- Problem:

    - The sample cannot represents the equatorial region properly
    - A sample on the equatorial region cannot represents the whole region

## Digital Image Analysis

- An alternative method proposed to evaluate the color of several fruits 

- Offers an objective measure for color and other physical factors

- Most recent applications include:
    - Fruit's classification
    - Postharvest quality evaluation 
    - Including meats, fruits, and seeds

## Conclusions

- Scanner can be used as a device to measure color components

- Colorimeter and digital image analysis leads to defferents peel color measurements

- Based on sample size we conclude:
    
    - The usage of images analysis is preferable compared with colorimeter approach
    - Digital images analysis should be used for fruits with non-uniform coloration
