        I am a seasoned statistician with over 13 years of experience in experimental statistics and statistical modelling. My research interests include statistical modelling, agriculture, genetics, and sports.

        Currently, I am a Consultant Statistician at AbacusBio, where I leverage my expertise in statistical methods and data analysis to drive impactful research and innovative solutions. My career has been marked by the application of both qualitative and quantitative methods to explore the role of science and technology across various sectors.

        I am passionate about using data to uncover insights and support decision-making processes. Whether it's improving agricultural outcomes or enhancing athletic performance, my goal is to apply rigorous statistical techniques to solve real-world problems.

        I invite you to explore my work, review my publications, and reach out if you are interested in collaboration or have any inquiries.
