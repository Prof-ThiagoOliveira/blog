### Development of predictive models and analytics techniques to forecast historical data-driven outcomes

**Summary**: 
Predictive modelling is a commonly used statistical technique to predict future behavior. Predictive modelling solutions are a form of data-mining technology that analyses historical and current data and generates a model to help predict future outcomes. In predictive modelling, data is collected, a statistical model is formulated, predictions are made, and the model is validated as additional data becomes available.

### Transmission efficiency of *xylella fastidiosa*

**Summary**:
*Xylella fastidiosa* is genetically diverse and has many vector species. However, there is limited information on vector specificity and efficiency for different sequence types (STs) Both STs of X. fastidiosa and vectors differ in their associations with plants

**Publications**:

1. [Transmission efficiency of xylella fastidiosa subsp. Pauca sequence types by sharpshooter vectors after in vitro acquisition, 2018](https://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/pdf/10.1094/PHYTO-07-18-0254-FI)
2. [Settling and feeding behavior of sharpshooter vectors on plum genotypes with different susceptibility levels to leaf scald disease (Xylella fastidiosa), 2020](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10658-020-02104-8)

### Sugarcane straw management for bioenergy

**Summary**:
Global warming can intensify the soil organic matter (SOM) turnover, damaging soil health. Crop residues left on the soil are important to maintain a positive SOM budget and nutrient cycling. But, sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) straw has been removed from the field for bioenergy purposes. We hypothesize that global warming, together with straw removal, will negatively impact Brazil’s ethanol carbon footprint.
