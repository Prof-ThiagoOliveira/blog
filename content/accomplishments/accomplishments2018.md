1. Machine Learning with caret in R, **DataCamp**, 4h, [certificate](https://www.datacamp.com/statement-of-accomplishment/course/cab13d01f8e885e2930590a7570441e508019f59)
    - <p align="justify">**Description**: Machine learning is the study and application of algorithms that learn from and make predictions on data. From search results to self-driving cars, it has manifested itself in all areas of our lives and is one of the most exciting and fast growing fields of research in the world of data science. This course teaches the big ideas in machine learning: how to build and evaluate predictive models, how to tune them for optimal performance, how to preprocess data for better results, and much more. The popular caret R package, which provides a consistent interface to all of R's most powerful machine learning facilities, is used throughout the course.</p>
