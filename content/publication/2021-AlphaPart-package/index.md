abstract: <p align="justify"> A software that implements a method for partitioning genetic trends to quantify the sources of genetic gain in breeding programmes. The partitioning method is described in Garcia-Cortes et al. (2008) <doi:10.1017/S175173110800205X>. The package includes the main function AlphaPart for partitioning breeding values and auxiliary functions for manipulating data and summarizing, visualizing, and saving results.</p>
