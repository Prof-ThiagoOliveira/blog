abstract: <p align="justify"> The continuously growing number of COVID-19 cases pressures healthcare services worldwide. Accurate short-termforecasting is thus vital to support country-level policy making. The strategies adopted by countries to combat the pandemicvary, generating different uncertainty levels about the actual number of cases. Accounting for the hierarchical structure ofthe data and accommodating extra-variability is therefore fundamental. We introduce a new modelling framework to describethe course of the pandemic with great accuracy, and provide short-term daily forecasts for every country in the world. We showthat our model generates highly accurate forecasts up to six days ahead, and use estimated model components to clustercountries based on recent events. We introduce statistical novelty in terms of modelling the autoregressive parameter as afunction of time, increasing predictive power and flexibility to adapt to each country. Our model can also be used to forecast thenumber of deaths, study the effects of covariates (such as lockdown policies), and generate forecasts for smaller regions withincountries. Consequently, it has strong implications for global planning and decision making. We constantly update forecastsand make all results freely available to any country in the world through an online Shiny dashboard.</p>
