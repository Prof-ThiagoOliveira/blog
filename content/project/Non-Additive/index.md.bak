title: Analysis of non-additive genetic variance in breeding programmes
---

<p align="justify">
This seeding project aims to build a proof of concept for extending our recently developed framework for temporal and genomic analysis of additive genetic variance in breeding programmes to non-additive genetic variance. The primary purpose of this extension is to quantify the magnitude of non-additive genetic variance and relatedy to quantify the contribution of inbreeding depression and heterosis to genetic gain in breeding programmes.
