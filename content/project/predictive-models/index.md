title: Development of predictive models and analytics techniques to forecast historical data-driven outcomes

<p align="justify">
Predictive modelling is a commonly used statistical technique to predict future behavior. Predictive modelling solutions are a form of data-mining technology that analyses historical and current data and generates a model to help predict future outcomes. In predictive modelling, data is collected, a statistical model is formulated, predictions are made, and the model is validated as additional data becomes available.
