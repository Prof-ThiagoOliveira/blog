## About Me

<div style="text-align: justify;">
I am Thiago de Paula Oliveira, a statistician at AbacusBio. My work spans statistical modelling across agriculture, genetics, and sports analytics. I design and implement advanced mixed‑model and Bayesian methods, develop economic and sustainability selection indices, and build reproducible, interactive data‑visualisation dashboards. I also develop production‑quality code in R, C++, Bash, and other languages, including package development and workflow automation, to ensure scalable, transparent analyses. My focus is on delivering decision‑ready outputs that improve agricultural productivity, accelerate genetic gain, and enhance athletic performance.
