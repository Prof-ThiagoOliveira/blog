I hold a PhD in Statistics from the University of São Paulo, Brazil, and have at least eight years of experience in experimental statistics, statistical modelling, and concordance analysis. As a PhD candidate, I was a visiting Scholar at the National University of Ireland in 2016, working with statistical modelling for agricultural data. Besides, I was a lecturer in the Department of Exact Sciences at ESALQ/University of São Paulo, Piracicaba, São Paulo, Brazil from 2017 to 2019.

I worked as a Researcher Biostatistician from 2019-2020 at Insight Centre for Data Analytics in partnership with Orreco, School of Mathematics, Statistics, and Applied Mathematics, and NUI Galway in the development of statistical methods applied to athlete performance, and predictive models for COVID-19. I developed statistical methods in longitudinal concordance correlation, multilevel model (hierarchical model), generalized linear mixed-effects model, state-space models, experimental design, longitudinal data.

As an enthusiast of the usage of dashboard apps to create an interactive data visualization, I believe that interactive applications are an easier way to create visual representations of large scale data sets, allowing the user explore the complex reality of the database, or even handle multiple sets of data in a single visualization.

Recently, I was awarded a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Individual Fellowship to work at The Roslin Institute - The University of Edinburgh, where I currently work on the development of statistical models applied to quantitative genetics and genomics of plant breeding in partnership with <a href="https://www.lgseeds.co.uk/">Limagrain</a>.
