<p align="justify">
I am a highly skilled and accomplished statistician with over 10 years of experience in experimental statistics and statistical modelling. I hold a PhD in Statistics from the <a href="https://www5.usp.br/">University of São Paulo</a>, Brazil, and during my PhD studies, I gained expertise in statistical modelling in agricultural data while working as a visiting scholar at the National University of Ireland Galway, Ireland. After completing my PhD, I worked as a lecturer at ESALQ/University of São Paulo from 2017 to 2019.

In 2019, I joined the <a href="https://www.insight-centre.org/">Insight Centre for Data Analytics</a> in partnership with <a href="https://www.orreco.com/">Orreco</a>, School of Mathematics, Statistics, and Applied Mathematics, and <a href="https://www.universityofgalway.ie/">NUI Galway</a> as a Researcher Biostatistician. I contributed significantly to the development of statistical methods applied to athlete performance and predictive models for COVID-19, where I worked on developing statistical methods in longitudinal concordance correlation, multilevel model (hierarchical model), generalized linear mixed-effects model, state-space models, experimental design, and longitudinal data.

I am not only an accomplished statistician but also an advocate for using dashboard apps to create interactive data visualization. I believe that apps are an efficient tool to make visual representations of large scale data sets and enable users to explore the complex reality of the database, or even handle multiple data locations in a single visualization.

In 2020, I was awarded a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/actions/individual-fellowships_en">Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) COFOUND Fellowship (Train@Ed)</a> to work at <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/roslin">The Roslin Institute</a>, University of Edinburgh where I worked on developing statistical models applied to quantitative genetics genomics of plant and animal breeding, and I am excited to bring my expertise to the <a href="https://abacusbio.com/">AbacusBio</a> team.

Apart from my professional achievements, I also have an extensive publication record in the field of statistics, showcasing my expertise in the area. In my free time, I enjoy photography, which I see as a way to capture the beauty of the world around me.
