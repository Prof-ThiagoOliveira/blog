He was a Researcher Biostatistician at Insight 
Centre for Data Analytics working in partnership with Orreco and NUI
Galway in the development of <ins>statistical methods applied to athlete performance</ins>. 
Thiago developed statistical methods in longitudinal 
concordance correlation, multilevel model (hierarchical model), 
generalized linear mixed-effects model, experimental design, longitudinal
data. 
</p>

<p align="justify">
As an enthusiast of use of <ins>dashboard apps</ins> to create interactive data visualization, Thiago belives that interactive applications is an easier way to create visual representations of large data sets, allowing the user explore the complex reality of the database, or even handle multiple sets of data in a single visualization.
</p>
