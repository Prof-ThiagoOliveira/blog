      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&#34;justify&#34;&gt;The continuously growing number of COVID-19 cases pressures healthcare services worldwide. Accurate short-term forecasting is thus vital to support country-level policy making. The strategies adopted by countries to combat the pandemic vary, generating different uncertainty levels about the actual number of cases. Accounting for the hierarchical structure of the data and accommodating extra-variability is therefore fundamental. We introduce a new modelling framework to describe the course of the pandemic with great accuracy, and provide short-term daily forecasts for every country in the world. We show that our model generates highly accurate forecasts up to six days ahead, and use estimated model components to cluster countries based on recent events. We introduce statistical novelty in terms of modelling the autoregressive parameter as a function of time, increasing predictive power and flexibility to adapt to each country. Our model can also be used to forecast the number of deaths, study the effects of covariates (such as lockdown policies), and generate forecasts for smaller regions within countries. Consequently, it has strong implications for global planning and decision making. We constantly update forecasts and make all results freely available to any country in the world through an online Shiny dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Estimating NBA athlete performance using multilevel models</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/event/2020-nuig/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&#34;justify&#34;&gt;In basketball, the athlete performance evaluation are generally based on variants of plus-minus and PER statistics Optimizing Athlete Performance calculated through multiple regression, ridge, or lasso models using likelihood-based or Bayesian approach. We developed a novel methodology based on principal components analysis and multilevel model to create new indexes such as Oliveira-Newell Score that can be used to evaluate player performance during a match, relevance score used to rank players in a season, and the consistence score used to evaluate the player contribution for their team based on random effects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The longitudinal concordance correlation</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/event/2019-iwsm/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&#34;justify&#34;&gt;We present the lcc package, available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). The package implements estimation procedures for the longitudinal concordance correlation (LCC), using fixed effects and variance components estimates from linear mixed models. The LCC is a quantity that measures the extent of agreement between two (or more) methods used to evaluate a response variable of interest and is frequently applied in medicine, pharmacology, and agronomy. The main features of the package are the estimation and inference of the extent of agreement using numerical and graphical summaries. Moreover, our approach presents flexibility in the sense that it accommodates both balanced and unbalanced experimental designs, allows for different within-group error structures, while also allowing for the inclusion of covariates in the linear predictor to control systematic variations in the response. We illustrate our methodology by comparing different methods used to measure the peel colour of fruit as an assessment of ripeness.&lt;/p&gt;
