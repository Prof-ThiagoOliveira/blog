After completing my PhD, I worked as a lecturer at ESALQ/University of São Paulo from 2017 to 2019.\rIn 2019, I joined the Insight Centre for Data Analytics in partnership with Orreco, School of Mathematics, Statistics, and Applied Mathematics, and NUI Galway as a Researcher Biostatistician. I contributed significantly to the development of statistical methods applied to athlete performance and predictive models for COVID-19, where I worked on developing statistical methods in longitudinal concordance correlation, multilevel model (hierarchical model), generalized linear mixed-effects model, state-space models, experimental design, and longitudinal data.\rI am not only an accomplished statistician but also an advocate for using dashboard apps to create interactive data visualization. I believe that apps are an efficient tool to make visual representations of large scale data sets and enable users to explore the complex reality of the database, or even handle multiple data locations in a single visualization.\rIn 2020, I was awarded a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) COFOUND Fellowship (Train@Ed) to work at The Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh where I worked on developing statistical models applied to quantitative genetics genomics of plant and animal breeding, and I am excited to bring my expertise to the AbacusBio team.\rApart from my professional achievements, I also have an extensive publication record in the field of statistics, showcasing my expertise in the area.

Afterward, you can build a ggplot by mapping different variables in your data source to different aesthetics. For example, there are colour, shape, size of points, the position of the x or y-axis, ans so on.

For an introduction to the ggplot package, you can check out the visualization and data structure lecture. When you call ggplot, you should provide a data source, usually a data frame or tibble. Afterward, you can build a ggplot by mapping different variables in your data source to different aesthetics. For example, there are colour, shape, size of points, the position of the x or y-axis, ans so on. To demonstrate this and even more procedures using ggplot, we will work with different data sets such as:\n\rGrowth of Orange Trees: the Orange data frame has 35 rows and 3 columns of records of the growth of orange trees.\r\rglimpse(Orange)\r## Rows: 35\r## Columns: 3\r## $ Tree \u0026lt;ord\u0026gt; 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3,…\r## $ age \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; 118, 484, 664, 1004, 1231, 1372, 1582, 118, 484, 664, 10…\r## $ circumference \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; 30, 58, 87, 115, 120, 142, 145, 33, 69, 111, 156, 172, 2…\r\rStorm tracks data: This data is a subset of the NOAA Atlantic hurricane database best track data, https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/#hurdat.

This data has 142 countries observed from the year 1952 to 2007 in increments of 5 years. The response variable observed was the life expectancy at birth (in years), population size, and Per capita gross domestic product (GDP).\nPer capita gross domestic product (GDP) measures a country’s economic response per person and is calculated by dividing its GDP by its population. It is a global measure for gauging the prosperity of nations as we can analyze the worth of a country based on its economic growth. Thus, countries that have the highest per capita GDP tend to be more developed.\ngapminder\r## # A tibble: 1,704 × 6\r## country continent year lifeExp pop gdpPercap\r## \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt; \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;\r## 1 Afghanistan Asia 1952 28.8 8425333 779.\r## 2 Afghanistan Asia 1957 30.3 9240934 821.\r## 3 Afghanistan Asia 1962 32.0 10267083 853.\r## 4 Afghanistan Asia 1967 34.0 11537966 836.\r## 5 Afghanistan Asia 1972 36.1 13079460 740.\r## 6 Afghanistan Asia 1977 38.4 14880372 786.\r## 7 Afghanistan Asia 1982 39.9 12881816 978.\r## 8 Afghanistan Asia 1987 40.8 13867957 852.\r## 9 Afghanistan Asia 1992 41.7 16317921 649.\r## 10 Afghanistan Asia 1997 41.8 22227415 635.\r## # … with 1,694 more rows\rQuestions:\nWhat are the ten highest gdpPercap values?\r\rgapminder %\u0026gt;%\r slice_max(gdpPercap, n = 10)\r## # A tibble: 10 × 6\r## country continent year lifeExp pop gdpPercap\r## \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt; \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;\r## 1 Kuwait Asia 1957 58.0 212846 113523.\r## 2 Kuwait Asia 1972 67.7 841934 109348.\r## 3 Kuwait Asia 1952 55.6 160000 108382.\r## 4 Kuwait Asia 1962 60.5 358266 95458.\r## 5 Kuwait Asia 1967 64.6 575003 80895.\r## 6 Kuwait Asia 1977 69.3 1140357 59265.\r## 7 Norway Europe 2007 80.2 4627926 49357.\r## 8 Kuwait Asia 2007 77.6 2505559 47307.\r## 9 Singapore Asia 2007 80.0 4553009 47143.\r## 10 Norway Europe 2002 79.0 4535591 44684.\rFind both the median life expectancy (lifeExp) and the median and maximum GDP per capita (gdpPercap) in 1957, 1982, and 2007, by country and continent.

This technical exploration delves into three sophisticated modelling techniques:\r\rPolynomial Models,\rFractional Polynomials, and\rSpline Models.\r\rEach of these models serves as a fundamental tool in the statistical toolkit, enabling us to capture and understand the intricacies of linear and non-linear relationships inherent in real-world data.\rAs a bio-statistician entrenched in the technical aspects of data analysis, I recognize the critical importance of these models. We will commence with an examination of Polynomial Models, discussing their mathematical underpinnings and practical applications in capturing curvilinear trends. Next, we will navigate through the Fractional Polynomials, a more flexible extension of traditional polynomials, adept at modelling asymmetric patterns. Lastly, we will explore Spline Models, one of the most flexible approach in data fitting, capable of adapting to complex and segmented patterns in data.\rThis post is designed not just to inform but to provide a technical understanding of these models with examples, illustrating their relevance and application in contemporary data analysis. Whether you are a data scientist, a statistician, or a researcher grappling with complex data sets, this exploration aims to enhance the modelling arsenal, offering insights into when and how to apply these models effectively.\rPolynomial Models\rPolynomial Models, represented by functions of the form \\[y = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \\ldots + a_1 x + a_0,\\] are foundational in modelling curvilinear relationships. In this formulation, each \\(a_i\\) (where \\(i = 0, 1, \\ldots, n\\)) denotes the coefficient corresponding to the \\(i\\)-th term of the polynomial, and \\(x\\) is the independent or exploratory variable. The degree \\(n\\) of the polynomial determines the model’s complexity, with higher degrees allowing for more intricate curve shapes.\rThese models are particularly useful in capturing the non-linear dynamics often observed in real-world data. For instance, a quadratic model (where \\(n = 2\\)) can describe simple parabolic trends, while higher-degree models, such as cubic (\\(n = 3\\)) or quartic (\\(n = 4\\)), enable the representation of more complex and varied behaviours (Figure 1).\r\rFigure 1: Comparative Visualization of Polynomial Fits: Degrees 1 to 4\r\rHowever, increasing the degree \\(n\\) also increases the risk of overfitting, a phenomenon where the model adapts too closely to the specificities of the training data, including noise, at the expense of generalizability to new data (Figure 2). Overfitting leads to models that perform poorly in predictive scenarios, failing to capture the true underlying trend.\r\rFigure 2: Visualizing Model Complexity: Parsimonious vs Overfit Polynomial Fits\r\rPolynomial models are extensively applied across various disciplines. In physics, they are instrumental in modelling motion under uniform acceleration, among other phenomena. In economics, polynomial trends are fitted to time series data to understand market dynamics. In biological sciences, these models aid in interpreting growth rates and simple gene expression patterns. The interpretation of the coefficients \\(a_i\\) can provide significant insights; for instance, in the quadratic model \\(y = ax^2 + bx + c\\), the sign of \\(a\\) determines the direction in which the parabola opens, offering crucial information about the nature of the relationship being modelled (Figure 3).\r\rFigure 3: Parabola Opening Upwards and Downwards\r\rIn practical applications, the selection of the polynomial degree \\(n\\) is critical. It is a balance between capturing the complexity of the data and avoiding overfitting (Figure 2). Techniques such as cross-validation, where the data is divided into training and testing sets, can be used to determine the optimal degree of the polynomial. Additionally, statistical measures like the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) or the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) are often employed to select the most appropriate model by balancing model fit and complexity.\rIn summary, Polynomial Models are a versatile and powerful tool in statistical modelling. Their ability to approximate complex functions with a relatively straightforward mathematical formulation makes them a fundamental component in various fields of data analysis.\rWhile traditional polynomial models are highly effective, they sometimes lack the flexibility required for certain types of data, particularly those exhibiting asymmetric trends. This limitation led to the development of fractional polynomial models, which extend the concept of polynomial models by allowing for fractional exponents. This advancement provides a greater ability to fit a wider range of curves and is especially useful in cases where the relationship between variables is not adequately captured by integer exponents.\r\rFractional Polynomial Models\rFractional Polynomials represent an advanced evolution of traditional polynomial models, marked by their use of non-integer, real-number exponents in the independent variable. Mathematically, they are expressed as \\[y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x^{p_1} + \\beta_2 x^{p_2} + \\ldots + \\beta_n x^{p_n},\\] where \\(x\\) is the independent variable, \\(\\beta_i\\) are coefficients, and \\(p_i\\) are the variable powers. These powers, unlike the integer-only powers in traditional polynomials, can include any real number like \\(0.5\\), \\(-1\\), or \\(2.3\\). This flexibility significantly broadens the modeling capability of polynomials, allowing for more precise fitting to complex and asymmetric data patterns. Terms such as \\(x^{-1}\\) and \\(x^{0.5}\\), representing the reciprocal and square root of \\(x\\) respectively, enable the modeling of relationships that exhibit dramatic changes over different ranges of \\(x\\), a task challenging for standard polynomial models with integer exponents.\r\rFigure 4: Comparative Visualization of Fractional Polynomial Fits\r\rThe utility of fractional polynomials extends to various fields, notably in medical statistics and biological data analysis, where data patterns often defy symmetry. They are particularly adept in modeling phenomena like dose-response curves in pharmacokinetics and progression rates of diseases, where the response changes in a non-linear fashion. Such flexibility makes them invaluable in scenarios where data exhibit complex, non-standard behaviors.\rHowever, the complexity of fractional polynomials can pose interpretational challenges, and like their traditional counterparts, they are susceptible to overfitting. This risk is heightened with the inclusion of multiple fractional terms or higher degrees, necessitating careful model selection and validation processes. Methods such as cross-validation or the use of information criteria like AIC or BIC are often employed to balance model fit against the risk of overfitting.\rFinding Optimal Power Values in Fractional Polynomials\rThe process of finding the best values for \\(p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n\\) is inherently iterative and may require a combination of statistical testing, validation techniques, and expert judgement. The goal is to have a balance between a model that fits the data well, is not overly complex, and is robust to variations in model parameters.\rIn Figure 5, I exemplify this process by fitting various fractional polynomial models to the dataset. Through the application of the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), I identified the most parsimonious model, which is succinctly expressed mathematically as \\[y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x^{1.13},\\] and the corresponding BIC value for this model is denoted as \\(−144.34\\).\r\rFigure 5: Comparative Visualization of Fractional Polynomial Fits\r\rBelow I have described some possible approaches to achieve this objective:\rInitial Power Selection: Start with a set of candidate powers, often including a mix of positive, negative, and fractional values. Common choices are \\(-2, -1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3\\). The selection of these initial powers is guided by prior knowledge about the data, theoretical considerations, or exploratory analysis.\rModel Fitting and Comparison: Fit fractional polynomial models using different combinations of these candidate powers. This fitting can be done using least squares regression or other suitable methods depending on the nature of the data. For each model, compute a goodness-of-fit statistic, such as the residual sum of squares (RSS) or the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC).\rIterative Testing: Employ an iterative approach to test various combinations of powers. This might involve starting with a simple model and gradually adding complexity (increasing the number of terms) while monitoring the improvement in the fit.\rCross-Validation: To guard against overfitting, especially in models with higher degrees or more terms, use cross-validation. Divide your data into training and testing sets. Fit the model to the training set and evaluate its performance on the testing set. This step helps in assessing the model’s predictive accuracy.\rStatistical Significance: Assess the statistical significance of the coefficients associated with each term in the model. Non-significant terms might suggest that certain powers do not contribute meaningfully to the model and could be excluded.\rModel Selection Criteria: Use model selection criteria like AIC or BIC to compare models with different combinations of powers. These criteria balance the goodness of fit with the complexity of the model, helping to choose a model that is both accurate and parsimonious.\rSensitivity Analysis: Conduct sensitivity analyses by varying the powers slightly to see how robust the model is to changes in these parameters. This step is crucial to understand the stability and reliability of the model.\rWhile fractional polynomials offer enhanced modelling flexibility over traditional polynomials, they sometimes fall short in handling data with distinct behavioural changes across different segments. This limitation summed to the difficulty in determine \\(p_i\\) are where spline models come into play. Spline models, constructed as piecewise polynomials, provide localized fitting capabilities, adapting seamlessly to variations within different data segments. Such adaptability is particularly useful in datasets with distinct phases or regimes. Thus, spline models emerge as a natural progression when fractional polynomials alone are insufficient to model the intricate patterns present in the data\r\r\rSpline Models\r\rReferences\rCarrasco, J.

Mathematically, the CCC is defined as:\r\\[\\rho_c = \\frac{2\\sigma_{x,y}}{\\sigma_x^2 + \\sigma_y^2 + (\\mu_x - \\mu_y)^2} = \\frac{2\\rho\\sigma_x\\sigma_y}{\\sigma_x^2 + \\sigma_y^2 + (\\mu_x - \\mu_y)^2} = \\rho \\times C_b.\\]\nIn this formula, \\(\\sigma_x\\) and \\(\\sigma_y\\) are the standard deviations of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), respectively, showing the variability within each set of measurements. The means, \\(\\mu_x\\) and \\(\\mu_y\\), represent the central tendency of each dataset. The term \\(\\rho\\) is Pearson’s correlation coefficient, expressing the linear association between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), while \\(C_b\\), the bias correction factor, quantifies the deviation of the best-fit line from the 45-degree line through the origin—the line of perfect agreement. A \\(C_b\\) of 1 indicates no bias, and values close to 1 signify an accurate agreement.\rUnderstanding the concepts of precision and accuracy is crucial for grasping the essence of CCC (Concordance Correlation Coefficient). Let’s break down these components:\rPrecision: This aspect refers to the consistency or repeatability of measurements (Figure 1). Imagine a target with a bullseye:\r\rIf you shoot a series of arrows, and they all land very close to each other but not necessarily near the bullseye, this demonstrates high precision. The arrows are consistently hitting the same spot, showing that your measurements (in this case, arrow shots) are repeatable and reliable.\r\rHowever, high precision does not guarantee that you are hitting the target accurately. Your consistent shots might be clustered in a corner of the target, far from the bullseye.\r\r\rAccuracy: This term refers to how close the measurements are to the ‘true’ or accepted value (Figure 1). Continuing with the target analogy:\r\rIf your arrows hit or are very close to the bullseye, this indicates high accuracy. You are hitting the correct or intended spot.\r\rIt’s possible to be accurate without being precise if your arrows are scattered all around the bullseye, each hitting close but not in a consistent pattern.\r\r\r\r\rFigure 1: Example of precision and accuracy concept. The red dot in the center represents the bullseye.\r\rNow, applying these concepts to CCC. The CCC measures both the precision and accuracy of a set of measurements. It assesses the strength of the relationship between two variables (precision) and how closely these measurements agree with the ‘true’ or accepted values (accuracy). A high CCC indicates that not only are the measurements consistent with each other (precision), but they also closely match the true values (accuracy). In our analogy, this would be like consistently hitting the bullseye with every arrow.\rFurthermore, in the context of CCC, the concept of a “true” value is central. One variable is considered the standard or “true” measurement against which the other is compared. This distinction is vital because CCC is not merely a correlation but a measure of agreement. The notion of a “true” value in scientific research is intricate, often defined by theoretical constructs or consensus standards, and the assumption of truth can be challenged or refined with advancing knowledge and technology. Thus, CCC offers a way to quantitatively assess how well our measurements reflect what we accept as true, acknowledging that our understanding of “true” can evolve.\rTo illustrate, in Scenario 1, even with a Pearson correlation near 1, the CCC’s modest value signals a discrepancy from the true value, reflecting either a systematic bias or scale differences between the measurements. The dashed red line represents the line of perfect agreement, where the true values would ideally lie. This scenario underscores the necessity of considering both precision and accuracy—where precision alone can mislead, and accuracy is pivotal for measurements to be meaningful and trustworthy.\r\rFigure 2: Scenario 1 - High Pearson correlation with modest CCC indicating possible systematic bias or scale differences. The dashed line represents perfect agreement\r\rScenario 2 presents a contrasting picture with a CCC value of 0.95, indicating not only a strong linear relationship but also a high degree of concordance. In this instance, the measurements not only follow a consistent pattern (precision) but also align closely with the line of perfect agreement (accuracy), suggesting that one set of measurements can be reliably used as a surrogate for the true values.\r\rFigure 3: Scenario 2 - Strong linear relationship and high concordance with CCC at 0.95. The dashed line indicates the line of perfect agreement\r\rIn Scenario 3, we explore a scenario characterized by a negative Pearson correlation coefficient of approximately -0.44 and a Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) of -0.43. This specific case demands a tailored approach to understanding concordance within inverse relationships. Instead of using the \\(Y = X\\) line commonly associated with positive correlations, we introduce a new reference line represented by \\(Y = 100 - X\\) (depicted as the black dashed line in the plot). This reference line possesses a slope of -1 and serves as the benchmark for perfect inverse agreement.\r\rFigure 4: Scenario 3: Inverse relationship with both Pearson correlation and CCC around -0.44. The red dashed line represents \\(Y = X\\), the black dashed line is the \\(Y = 100 - X\\), and the blue solid line is the best fit line\r\rThe noteworthy aspect of this scenario lies in the high \\(C_b\\) value, which is approximately 0.98 (\\(C_b = \\frac{\\rho_c}{\\rho} = \\frac{-0.43}{-0.44}\\)). This value is calculated as the ratio of CCC to the Pearson correlation coefficient. While the negative Pearson correlation may not indicate a high precision, the elevated \\(C_b\\) value implies that \\(Y\\) and \\(X\\) are almost perfectly accurate.\rNow, let’s take a closer look at an intriguing scenario. If we push the Pearson correlation to the extreme, reaching -1, we witness a perfect inverse agreement. In this scenario, every data point converges precisely onto the black dashed line, forming an impeccable alignment. Notably, even the best fit line mirrors this black dashed line in perfect harmony, showcasing the unparalleled concordance in this exceptional case.\r\rFigure 5: Scenario 4: Inverse relationship with both Pearson correlation varying from -0.43 to -1. The red dashed line represents \\(Y = X\\), the black dashed line is the \\(Y = 100 - X\\), and the blue solid line is the best fit line\r\rIn Scenario 5, the CCC value of 0 denotes absolute non-concordance, indicating that the variability between the measurements does not correspond to the variability expected by chance alone. This suggests that the measurements lack any systematic agreement and cannot be used interchangeably or as reliable estimates of one another. The complete absence of concordance highlights the importance of accuracy in measurement, underscoring that precision without accuracy does not yield valid or useful data in reflecting the assumed “true” values.\r\rFigure 6: Scenario 5 - No agreement with CCC at 0\r\rThese scenarios vividly demonstrate the nuanced interplay between precision and accuracy within the framework of CCC. They bring to light the importance of accuracy in scientific measurement and the limitations of relying solely on correlation coefficients for assessing the validity and reliability of data.\rTo further strengthen the discussion, we must consider the assumptions and limitations of CCC. It assumes that the data scales are continuous and that the relationship between the measures is linear. The presence of outliers can unduly influence the CCC, and it may not be suitable for all data types. Additionally, the CCC does not account for random error, which can affect measurements variably.\rWhen considering alternative measures, such as Bland-Altman plots, we can address scenarios where CCC is less suitable, like non-normal data or comparisons of more than two measurement sets.\rIn practical terms, CCC can be used to validate new measurement methods against established gold standards, underscoring its application in method comparison studies. Real-world examples where CCC has been pivotal could include its use in clinical settings for comparing measurement techniques, methods of colour measurements in agriculture, and model diagnostic in statistics.\rFor computational purposes, the statistical environment R has functions and libraries dedicated to calculating CCC, making it accessible for researchers and practitioners to apply this measure to their data. The epiR package in R, for instance, provides a function epi.ccc specifically for calculating Lin’s CCC.\rIf one prefers to write a custom function in R for educational or analytical purposes, the following function can be used to compute a point estimate for Lin’s Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC):\r#\u0026#39; Calculate Lin\u0026#39;s Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC)\r#\u0026#39;\r#\u0026#39; This function computes Lin\u0026#39;s Concordance Correlation Coefficient to evaluate the agreement\r#\u0026#39; between two sets of measurements.

It then computes the means (\\(mean_x\\) and \\(mean_y\\)) and variances (\\(var_x\\) and \\(var_y\\)) of the two sets of measurements. The CCC is calculated by combining these values according to the formula, thereby quantifying the agreement between the two measurements in terms of both precision and accuracy.\rUsing the custom ccc function provides a straightforward computation of Lin’s Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) for research applications, particularly when a simple estimate of concordance is required. However, for a more comprehensive analysis, the epi.ccc function from the epiR package is advantageous as it not only computes CCC but also provides confidence intervals for the CCC value, offering a statistical range within which the true concordance lies with a certain probability. This is crucial for making inferences about the precision of the agreement between measurements in research.\rFor those looking to apply CCC specifically to Lin’s method, both the epiR package and the DescTools package on CRAN offer robust tools. The DescTools package provides a comprehensive collection of statistical functions, including methods for calculating CCC.\rFor studies involving repeated measures, where the same subjects are measured under different conditions or at different times, the lcc package offers functions for calculating CCC for longitudinal data, taking into account the within-subject correlation.\rAdditionally, the cccrm package provides functions for calculating the CCC for repeated (and non-repeated) measures, catering to a wide range of research designs and ensuring that the variability inherent in repeated measures is appropriately accounted for.\rThese packages are valuable additions to the toolkit of researchers, statisticians, and data analysts, enhancing the reliability and interpretability of concordance assessments in scientific studies.\rR code used to produce the data and plots\r# Load necessary libraries\rlibrary(MASS)\rlibrary(ggplot2)\r# Function to calculate Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC)\rccc \u0026lt;- function(x, y) {\r# Check if inputs are numeric vectors\rstopifnot(is.numeric(x), is.numeric(y))\r# Calculate Pearson\u0026#39;s correlation coefficient\rrho \u0026lt;- cor(x, y)\r# Calculate means of x and y\rmean_x \u0026lt;- mean(x)\rmean_y \u0026lt;- mean(y)\r# Calculate variances of x and y\rvar_x \u0026lt;- var(x)\rvar_y \u0026lt;- var(y)\r# Calculate CCC based on the formula\rccc_value \u0026lt;- (2 * rho * sqrt(var_x) * sqrt(var_y)) / (var_x + var_y + (mean_x - mean_y)^2)\rreturn(ccc_value)\r}\r# Set seed for reproducibility\rset.seed(123)\r# Function to generate and plot data for each scenario\rdata_plot \u0026lt;- function(mean, cov, scenario_number) {\rdata \u0026lt;- mvrnorm(100, mu = mean, Sigma = cov)\rdf \u0026lt;- data.frame(x = data[,1], y = data[,2])\rtitle \u0026lt;- ifelse(scenario_number == 3 || scenario_number == 4,\rpaste(\u0026quot;Scenario\u0026quot;, scenario_number, \u0026quot;: Pearson =\u0026quot;, round(cor(df$x, df$y), 2), \u0026quot;CCC =\u0026quot;, round(ccc(df$x, df$y), 2)),\rpaste(\u0026quot;Scenario\u0026quot;, scenario_number, \u0026quot;: CCC =\u0026quot;, round(ccc(df$x, df$y), 2)))\rp \u0026lt;- ggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_point(color = \u0026quot;blue\u0026quot;, alpha = 0.6, size = 3) +\rggtitle(title) +\rxlab(\u0026quot;X values\u0026quot;) +\rylab(\u0026quot;Y values\u0026quot;) +\rtheme_minimal() +\rtheme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = \u0026quot;bold\u0026quot;, size = 14),\raxis.title.x = element_text(face = \u0026quot;bold\u0026quot;, size = 12),\raxis.title.y = element_text(face = \u0026quot;bold\u0026quot;, size = 12),\raxis.text.x = element_text(size = 10),\raxis.text.y = element_text(size = 10))\rif (scenario_number == 3 || scenario_number == 4) {\rp \u0026lt;- p + geom_smooth(method = \u0026quot;lm\u0026quot;, color = \u0026quot;blue\u0026quot;, se = FALSE) +\rgeom_abline(slope = -1, intercept = 100, linetype = \u0026quot;dashed\u0026quot;, color = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;) +\rgeom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, linetype = \u0026quot;dashed\u0026quot;, color = \u0026quot;red\u0026quot;)\r} else {\rp \u0026lt;- p + geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, linetype = \u0026quot;dashed\u0026quot;, color = \u0026quot;red\u0026quot;)\r}\rprint(p)\r}\r# Scenario 1: High Pearson correlation, modest CCC\rdata_plot(c(50, 70), matrix(c(100, 0.99 * sqrt(100) * sqrt(150), 0.99 * sqrt(100) * sqrt(150), 150), 2), 1)\r# Scenario 2: High CCC\rdata_plot(c(50, 50), matrix(c(100, 0.95 * sqrt(100) * sqrt(100), 0.95 * sqrt(100) * sqrt(100), 100), 2), 2)\r# Scenario 3: Negative Pearson and CCC\rdata_plot(c(50, 50), matrix(c(100, -0.3 * sqrt(100) * sqrt(150), -0.3 * sqrt(100) * sqrt(150), 150), 2), 3)\r# Scenario 4 (previously 5): Perfect inverse agreement\rdata_plot(c(50, 50), matrix(c(100, -1 * sqrt(100) * sqrt(100), -1 * sqrt(100) * sqrt(100), 100), 2), 4)\r# Scenario 5 (previously 4): No correlation (CCC = 0)\rdata_plot(c(50, 50), matrix(c(100, 0, 0, 150), 2), 5)\r\rReferences\rCarrasco, J.

Snippets, small reusable blocks of code, are a cornerstone in achieving this. This post delves into the world of snippets, offering both novice and seasoned R programmers insights into their power and versatility.\rWhat are Snippets?\rIn R programming, snippets are more than just pre-written bits of code; they are dynamic templates designed to streamline code writing and editing. Snippets in R can contain placeholders, which are special fields that can be easily tabbed through and filled in by the programmer. This feature allows for rapid customization of the snippet to fit specific coding needs. They can encapsulate complex coding patterns, data structures, and algorithms, making them particularly useful for tasks that require adherence to specific coding standards or methodologies.\rSnippets can be simple, such as a line to import a commonly used library, or complex, containing entire functions or control structures. They support variable interpolation, enabling the inclusion of dynamic content like dates, user names, or contextual code. Advanced snippets may even include scriptable transformations of the inserted text, allowing for sophisticated code generation based on the user’s input.\r\rAdvantages of Using Snippets\r\rEnhanced Productivity: Snippets go beyond automating repetitive code insertion. They serve as a framework for implementing best practices and methodologies, significantly reducing the cognitive load on the programmer. By providing ready-to-use code templates, they allow programmers to focus on the unique aspects of their work, rather than the boilerplate code.\r\rError Reduction: The use of snippets minimizes syntax and logical errors not just through standardization, but also by embedding proven and tested code patterns. This is especially beneficial in complex programming tasks where the risk of introducing errors is high. It ensures that the fundamental building blocks of the code are sound, allowing programmers to concentrate on higher-level logic and functionality.\r\rCode Consistency: In collaborative projects, maintaining a consistent coding style and structure is vital for readability and maintainability. Snippets enforce a uniform coding convention, which is crucial when working in teams or when codebases are passed between different developers. They help in aligning the code with organizational or community standards, making the code more accessible and understandable to all team members.\r\rRapid Prototyping and Experimentation: Snippets enable quick assembly of code constructs, facilitating rapid prototyping and experimentation. This is particularly valuable in data science and statistical analysis, where various approaches and methods are often tested in quick succession.\r\rEducational Tool: For learners of R programming, snippets act as an educational tool, demonstrating best practices and exposing them to different coding styles and patterns. It accelerates the learning curve by providing examples of well-structured code.\r\r\rPotential Drawbacks of Using Snippets\rWhile snippets offer numerous advantages, there are some considerations to keep in mind:\r\rInflexibility in Complex Scenarios: Snippets are excellent for routine tasks, but they may not always suit more complex, unique programming challenges. Overusing snippets in such scenarios can lead to inefficient or convoluted code, especially if the snippet doesn’t align perfectly with the specific requirements of the task.\r\rMaintenance Challenges: Snippets, like any other code, require maintenance. As the R language and associated packages evolve, snippets might become outdated, leading to compatibility issues or deprecated practices. Keeping a library of snippets up-to-date can be a task in itself.\r\rStandardization vs. Creativity: While standardization is an advantage, it can sometimes stifle creativity and innovation in coding. Relying heavily on snippets may discourage developers from exploring new or unconventional solutions to programming problems.\r\r\rThus, while snippets are a powerful tool in R programming, understanding and mitigating these potential drawbacks is crucial for effective and efficient use. It’s important to balance the convenience of snippets with the need for deep understanding, creativity, and code efficiency.\r\r\rIntegrating Snippets into R\rMost R Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), such as RStudio, have built-in support for snippets. They allow for easy creation, modification, and insertion of snippets into your code.\r\rExample of Snippets for R Programming\rFunction Declaration (advFun)\nsnippet advFun\r${1:function_name} \u0026lt;- function(${2:args}, ${3:optional_args = default_values}) {\rtryCatch({\r${4:body}\rreturn(${5:result})\r}, error = function(e) {\rstop(\u0026quot;Error in ${1:function_name}: \u0026quot;, e)\r})\r}\rConditional Execution (three_statements)\nsnippet three_statements\rif (${1:primary_condition}) {\r${2:primary_action}\r} else if (${3:secondary_condition}) {\r${4:secondary_action}\r} else {\r${5:alternative_action}\r}\rFor Loop (ForLoop)\nsnippet ForLoop\rfor (${1:var} in ${2:sequence}) {\rif (${3:break_condition}) {\rbreak\r} else if (${4:continue_condition}) {\rnext\r}\r${5:loop_body}\r}\rWhile Loop with Counter (whileLoopCounter)\nsnippet whileLoopCounter\r${1:counter} \u0026lt;- ${2:initial_value}\rwhile (${3:condition}) {\r${4:body}\r${1:counter} \u0026lt;- ${1:counter} + 1\rif (${1:counter} \u0026gt; ${5:max_iterations}) break\r}\rJoin and Transform Data with dplyr (dplyrJoinTransform)\nsnippet dplyrJoinTransform\r${1:result} \u0026lt;- ${2:dataset1} %\u0026gt;%\rinner_join(${3:dataset2}, by = \u0026quot;${4:key}\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;%\rdplyr::mutate(${5:new_column} = ${6:transformation}) %\u0026gt;%\rarrange(${7:order_column})\rRobust Exception Handling (robustTryCatch)\nsnippet robustTryCatch\rtryCatch({\r${1:expr}\r}, warning = function(w) {\rwarning(\u0026quot;Warning in ${1:expr}: \u0026quot;, w)\r}, error = function(e) {\rstop(\u0026quot;Error in ${1:expr}: \u0026quot;, e)\r}, finally = {\rmessage(\u0026quot;Executed ${1:expr}\u0026quot;)\r})\rPlotting with ggplot2 (ggplot_wrap)\nsnippet ggplot_wrap\rggplot(${1:data}, aes(${2:aes_params})) +\r${3:geom_layer} +\rfacet_wrap(~ ${4:facet_var}) +\rtheme_minimal() +\rtheme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +\rlabs(title = \u0026quot;${5:plot_title}\u0026quot;, x = \u0026quot;${6:x_label}\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;${7:y_label}\u0026quot;)\rData Reading (readData)\nsnippet readData\r${1:dataset} \u0026lt;- read.csv(\u0026quot;${2:file_path}\u0026quot;, header = ${3:TRUE}, na.strings = \u0026quot;${4:NA}\u0026quot;, stringsAsFactors = ${5:FALSE})\r\rThese snippets are formatted to be directly added to your R snippet library, making them easily accessible and usable within your R programming environment.\r\rEvaluating Code Performance with Snippet\rIn addition to the various functional and structural snippets, a key aspect of efficient programming is performance optimization. The measureCodeBottleneck snippet is an example of code for identifying performance bottlenecks in your R code. It helps you measure both execution time and memory usage, offering insights into how your code can be optimized for better performance.\rThe measureCodeBottleneck Snippet\rsnippet measureCodeBottleneck\rlibrary(microbenchmark)\rlibrary(pryr)\r# Memory and Time Measurement Function\rmeasureBottleneck \u0026lt;- function(expr) {\r# Measure execution time\rtime_result \u0026lt;- microbenchmark(expr, times = ${1:100})\rprint(summary(time_result))\r# Measure memory usage\rmem_usage \u0026lt;- object_size(expr)\rprint(paste(\u0026quot;Memory Usage: \u0026quot;, mem_usage))\r}\r# Example Usage\r# measureBottleneck({\r# # Place your code here\r# })\rThis snippet is particularly useful when working with large datasets or complex algorithms, where understanding and minimizing resource consumption is crucial.\r\r\rConclusion\rSnippets stand as a powerful asset in the toolkit of any R programmer, driving efficiency, reducing errors, and ensuring consistency across coding projects. Their integration into your daily workflow can be a game changer, significantly elevating both productivity and the quality of your code. However, it’s crucial to use snippets judiciously.\rWhile snippets are designed to save time and resources, their indiscriminate or inappropriate use can, paradoxically, lead to the opposite - a waste of time and a drain on resources. As you incorporate these snippets into your work, be mindful of their relevance and applicability to the task at hand. Choose and customize snippets that align closely with your specific coding needs and avoid the temptation to use a snippet when a more straightforward or tailored piece of code would be more efficient. This balanced approach to using snippets will ensure that you truly harness their potential to make your R programming more effective and streamlined.\rRemember, the goal is not just to code faster, but to code smarter. Snippets, when used thoughtfully, are a robust lever in achieving this goal.\r\r\rCitation\rFor attribution, please cite this work as:\r\rOliveira T.P. (2024, Jan. 06).

The golem package (Fay et al. 2021) makes it easier to develop these apps. It brings new tools and methods to this area, helping developers handle complex tasks more simply.\rMaking Things with Structure\rThink of making a sculpture out of clay. At first, the big lump of clay can be hard to handle. golem helps developers, like sculptors, by giving them a clear framework. This means instead of dealing with a big, confusing bunch of code, developers have an organized way to work. It is like having lines drawn on the clay, showing where to shape and smooth it.\r\rModular Component\rWhen I first stumbled upon the golem package for R’s Shiny applications, it was like discovering a secret garden in the world of coding. The stand-out feature for me? Its emphasis on modular coding. Let me break down why this is such a big deal.\rThink of building a Shiny app like crafting a beautiful mosaic. Each piece (or module) is unique and serves a specific purpose. When you put them all together, they create a stunning picture - your final application. This modular approach is not just about aesthetics; it is about making your coding life a whole lot easier.\rWhy Modules Make All the Difference\rOrganization: Breaking down the app into modules is like having a well-organized toolbox. Everything has its place, and you know exactly where to find it. It is incredibly satisfying and efficient.\r\rTeamwork Made Simple: If you are working in a team, modules are a lifesaver. Imagine each team member painting their part of a large canvas. With modules, you can work independently on different features without stepping on each other’s toes.\r\rDebugging: We have all been there - something is broken, and we have no idea where to start looking. With modular coding, it is like having a map with a big “X” marking the spot of the problem. A big simplication!\r\rReuse and Recycle: I love this part. Created a nifty user authentication module? You can plug it into your next project without reinventing the wheel. It is like having a secret recipe you can use over and over with minor adaptations when needed.\r\rGrowth Made Easy: As your app grows, you can just add new modules. It is like adding new rooms to a house. This scalability is one of most helpful feature for any developer.\r\rTesting: Testing each module separately means you can be super confident that every part of your app works perfectly before you put it all together.\r\rNewbie-Friendly: If someone new joins your project, it is much easier for them to get up to speed with a modular structure. It is like giving them a well-detailed map instead of a single, overwhelming blueprint.\r\r\r\rA Developer’s Toolbox\rgolem is not just about keeping things tidy. It is like a multi-tool for Shiny developers. It helps with JavaScript and CSS, makes app settings simpler, and improves how you work. golem also manages updates in R, making sure your app stays stable even when other parts of R change.\r\rDeployment and Documentation\rDeploying a Shiny app should feel like a victory lap, not a hurdle race. golem ensures this by packaging Shiny apps in a deployment-ready format. Be it RStudio Connect, Shinyapps.io, or the containerized world of Docker, your app is prepared and primed to go live.\rNow, let’s talk about something that does not always get the spotlight but is super crucial: documentation. golem knows how important this is. It is not just about coding; it is about leaving a trail of breadcrumbs for those who will follow in your footsteps. golem encourages you to document your work thoroughly. Think of it as creating a treasure map for future developers and collaborators who will join your project. Moreover, golem aligns seamlessly with the roxygen2 style of documentation, familiar to many R developers. This integration means that while you are crafting your Shiny app, you can simultaneously create comprehensive, easy-to-understand documentation. It is like having a dual toolkit - one for building your app and another for creating a clear, helpful guide for any future developer or user who ventures into your code. This approach not only saves time but also ensures that your documentation is as robust and user-friendly as the app you are building.\r\rConclusion\rgolem truly revolutionizes the way we handle R and Shiny applications. It is like having a GPS for the often complex journey of app development, guiding you with a structured, modular approach. This not only simplifies the process but also injects a sense of fun and creativity, much like piecing together a Lego masterpiece.\rBeyond just coding, golem makes deploying apps feel like a victory lap and turns documentation into an integral, rewarding part of the development cycle. With the added bonus of a supportive community, golem is more than just a tool - it is a companion for any developer venturing into the exciting world of Shiny applications. 🚀🌟\r\r\rReferences\rFay, Colin, Vincent Guyader, Sébastien Rochette, and Cervan Girard. 2021.

The proposed model represents the animal model as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), enabling a computationally efficient implementation that is conceptually equivalent to mixed model equations. The model offers several benefits, serving as a foundation for numerous animal model extensions and applicability in other environments. Quantitative geneticists can utilize this graphical model to clarify and discuss ideas about the underlying data generation process and propose novel statistical models or associations. The animal model, frequently employed in quantitative genetics, estimates individual breeding values based on observed phenotypic data and known relationships between individuals. It is especially useful in animal breeding programs aiming to enhance desirable traits, such as milk production in dairy cattle or meat quality in swine, which are often complex and influenced by multiple genes and environmental factors. By incorporating DAGs in the implementation of the animal model, the results become more reproducible, which is vital for constructing animal models and using DAGs to communicate outcomes or justify covariate selection. The model has the potential to improve the accuracy of breeding value estimates and inform breeding programs targeting desirable trait enhancement in animal populations. Additionally, its generic form can be used with MCMC methods to infer changes in additive genetic variance across generations due to the Bulmer effect, applicable in evolutionary studies. However, some initial programming experience is necessary for effective model utilization. In summary, this paper emphasizes the importance of reproducibility in constructing animal models and using DAGs for result communication, crucial for advancing quantitative genetic research. The proposed graphical model offers a flexible environment for quantitative genetics researchers, facilitating a deeper understanding of the underlying data structure and enabling informed decisions about covariate selection and new statistical model development. Moreover, the model has the potential to increase the accuracy of breeding value estimates and inform breeding programs focused on enhancing desirable traits in animal populations.\n","tags":["Quantitative Genetics","Animal Model","Bayesian","Effective Sample Size","BUGS Language","Directed acyclic graph (DAG)","MCMC methods","Graphical model"],"title":"Pedigree-based Animal Models Using Directed Acyclic Graphs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Thiago de Paula Oliveira","Jana Obsteter","Ivan Pocrnic","Nicolas Heslot","Gregor Gorjanc"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1675382400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1675382400,"objectID":"43e171c019bdfd92fe9f406dcd0aeb69","permalink":"https://prof-thiagooliveira.netlify.com/publication/2022-alphapartvariance/","publishdate":"2022-02-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022-alphapartvariance/","section":"publication","summary":"Partitioning method to quantify the contribution of different groups to genetic variance","tags":["Genetic trend","Genetic mean","Genetic variance","Partitioning","Bayesian","MCMC","AlphaPart"],"title":"A method for partitioning trends in genetic mean and variance to understand breeding practices","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cristiane Hayumi Taniguti","Lucas Mitsuo Taniguti","Rodrigo Rampazo Amadeu","Marcelo Mollinari","Guilherme da Silva Pereira","Oscar Riera-Lizarazu","Jeekin Lau","David Byrne","Gabriel de Siqueira Gesteira","Thiago de Paula Oliveira","Getulio Caixeta Ferreira","Antonio Augusto Franco Garcia"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1669334400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1669334400,"objectID":"c1968a49b1662d0b5bd5189879c0f33e","permalink":"https://prof-thiagooliveira.netlify.com/publication/2022-genotyping-by-sequencing/","publishdate":"2022-11-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022-genotyping-by-sequencing/","section":"publication","summary":"Reads2Map improves GBS data analysis by addressing genotyping errors, optimizing linkage maps, and offering dataset-specific solutions with a user-friendly app.","tags":["R Package","Genetic","Quantitative Genetic","Reads2Map Tools","Workflows"],"title":"Developing best practices for genotyping-by-sequencing analysis using linkage maps as benchmarks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Thiago de Paula Oliveira"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1663786800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1663786800,"objectID":"468d294ff75aca0c4f5eba3c5596c418","permalink":"https://prof-thiagooliveira.netlify.com/talk/quantifying-the-drivers-of-genetic-change-in-plant-breeding/","publishdate":"2021-09-12T12:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/quantifying-the-drivers-of-genetic-change-in-plant-breeding/","section":"event","summary":"Evaluate the contribution of germplasm origin given the heterotic pool in a maize breeding programme into contributions to additive genetic mean and variance summarized over the years","tags":["Breeding Programme","Maize","Genetic trend","Genetic mean","Genetic variance","Partitioning","Bayesian","MCMC","AlphaPart"],"title":"Quantifying the Drivers of Genetic Change in Plant Breeding","type":"event"},{"authors":["Thiago de Paula Oliveira"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1658948400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1658948400,"objectID":"155edccf49cb361c78f217886586d368","permalink":"https://prof-thiagooliveira.netlify.com/talk/a-method-for-partitioning-trends-in-genetic-mean-and-variance-to-understand-breeding-practices/","publishdate":"2021-09-20T12:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/a-method-for-partitioning-trends-in-genetic-mean-and-variance-to-understand-breeding-practices/","section":"event","summary":"Partitioning method to quantify the contribution of different groups to genetic variance and its impact in breeding programme","tags":["Genetic trend","Genetic mean","Genetic variance","Partitioning","Bayesian","MCMC","AlphaPart"],"title":"A method for partitioning trends in genetic mean and variance to understand breeding practices","type":"event"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This seeding project aims to build a proof of concept for extending our recently developed framework for temporal and genomic analysis of additive genetic variance in breeding programmes to non-additive genetic variance.

Every expression is a segment of a code that returns a value. For instance:\nThis example demonstrates the creation of variables to store values: a box for $x$ and another for $y$, where $y$ equals the expression $x + 13$ (thus, $y = 23$). Now, let\u0026rsquo;s delve into a more complex example:\nThis statement encompasses three expressions:\n* The results of the expression $3 - x$ is stored in the variable $y$\r* The expression $y = 3 - x$ returns the value of $y$, and it is stored in the variable $v$\r* The results of the expression $y \\times \\left(\\frac{v}{5} + x\\right)$ is stored in the variable $z$\r\rIt\u0026rsquo;s essential to remember the precedence of operations: multiplication and division are executed before addition and subtraction. For example:\n1-3*4 = -11\r2/3-4*2/3 = -2\r2/3-4/4*2/3 = 0\r Operator precedence in C++ determines the sequence of operations in an expression. Operators have a specific order of execution relative to others. For instance, in the expression $\\frac{2}{4} - 3 + 4 \\times 6$, the subexpressions $\\frac{2}{4}$and$4 \\times 6$ are calculated first, followed by the addition and subtraction. When operators have the same precedence, their associativity dictates the order - either left-to-right or right-to-left.\nPrecedence order\n\rAssociativity specifies the order of operations for operators with the same precedence level. It can be left-to-right or right-to-left. Typically, addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are left-associative, while assignment operators are right-associative. Some operators are non-associative, meaning their behaviour is undefined if used sequentially in an expression. Parentheses can alter the default associativity, enforcing a specific order.\nExample of left-associative, right-associative, and non-associative\n\rUsing Parentheses () The operator () has the highest precedente order (see Table 1), as consequence, we can use parentheses to change the sequence of operators. Consider the following example:\n5 + 6 * 7\r The * operator is evaluated firstly, followed by the + operator, so the result is $5+6\\times 7 = 47$. However, if we want to account for the addiction first and then the multiplication, we can rewrite the code as:\n(5 + 6) * 7\r Then, the program will compute $\\left(5+6\\right)\\times 7=11\\times 7=77$. Sometimes, parentheses' inclusion should be important to make your code easier to understand, and therefore easier to maintain.\nModulus operator (%) The modulus operator evaluates the remainder when dividing the first operand by the second one. Ex.: a % b is the remainder when $a$ is dividedby $b$ ($a$ modulus $b$).by $b$ ($a$ modulus $b$).\nExample of modulus\n\r* Dividing an integer by another one gives an integer.\r\rExample: int x = 10;\rint y = 3;\rx/y = 10/3 = 3 (dividing two integers)\rx % y = 1 (modulus)\r Short hand or syntatic sugar Short hand expressions provide a straightforward way to write common patterns over the algorithm for initialized variables.\n   Short hand Meaning Prefix and Postfix     $x+=y$ $x=x+y$    $x-=y$ $x=x-y$    $x*=y$ $x= x \\times y$    $x/=y$ $x=x/y$    $x++$ $x=x+1$ Return the value of $x$ first then increment it   $++x$ $x=x+1$ Increment first then return the value of $x$   $x\u0026ndash;$ $x=x-1$ Return the value of $x$ first then increment it   $\u0026ndash;x$ $x=x-1$ Increment first then return the value of $x$    Example 1: Here you can see that y ++= x * z; is calculate as $y=y+x \\times z = 30 + 2 \\times 4 = 38$.\nExample 2: In this example you can see that we used the postfix x++ to first initialize $y$ ($y=8 \\times x = 8 \\times 7 = 56$) and then update $x$ to x=x+1=8. On the other hand, we used the prefix --y to first update the variable $y$ to y=y-1=55 and then calculate the variable z using the updated $y$ $\\left(z = y/5 = 55/5 = 11 \\right)$.\nNote that when we use x*= (y/z) % 2 the variable $x$ multiply the entire expression after = symbol. This expression is equivalent to x = x * ((y/z) % 2));.\nOperator precedence and associativity Table 1 shows a list of precedence (ordered) and associativity of C operators.

This rule grammatically forbids some expressions that would be semantically invalid anyway. Many compilers ignore this rule and detect the invalidity semantically. For example, e = a \u0026lt; d ? a++ : a = d is an expression that cannot be parsed because of this rule. However, many compilers ignore this rule and parse it as e = ( ((a \u0026lt; d) ? (a++) : a) = d ), and then give an error because it is semantically invalid.\r\r\r\rImpact of Data Types on Expressions In C++, the data type of the variables involved in an expression significantly impacts the result. For instance, dividing two integers results in an integer, while using at least one floating-point number yields a floating-point result. Understanding how data types interact within expressions is crucial for accurate calculations and avoiding common pitfalls like integer truncation.\nHere are some key points about integer truncation and other common pitfalls in C++:\n  Integer Truncation: This occurs when the result of a division or other operation between integers is a floating-point number, but the data type is an integer. For example, int result = 5 / 2; will store 2 in result, not 2.5, as the fractional part is truncated.\n  Implicit Type Conversions: C++ automatically converts types in certain situations, which can lead to unexpected results. For instance, mixing signed and unsigned integers in expressions can cause unexpected behaviours due to implicit type conversions.\n  Overflow and Underflow: This happens when a variable is assigned a value outside its range. For example, storing a value larger than the maximum value that an int can hold will result in overflow, leading to unexpected values.\n  Precision Loss in Floating-Point Numbers: Floating-point variables can lose precision, especially when dealing with very large or very small numbers. This can result in rounding errors in calculations.\n  Division by Zero: This can occur if a program inadvertently divides a number by zero. It\u0026rsquo;s a critical error in C++ and can cause a program to crash or behave unpredictably.\n  Uninitialized Variables: Using variables before initializing them can lead to unpredictable results, as they may contain random data.\n  Pointer Errors: Common mistakes with pointers include dereferencing a null or uninitialized pointer, pointer arithmetic errors, and memory leaks.\n  Operator Precedence Mistakes: Misunderstanding the order in which operations are performed can lead to bugs. For example, assuming that a + b * c adds a and b before multiplying by c (it doesn\u0026rsquo;t; multiplication is done first).\n  Assuming Size of Data Types is Constant: The size of data types like int can vary depending on the system. Assuming a constant size can lead to errors, particularly when performing operations like bit manipulation or working with binary file formats.\n  Not Checking the Return Value of Functions: When functions return values to indicate success or failure, not checking these can lead to the program continuing as if nothing went wrong, even when errors have occurred.\n  Role of Type Casting in Expressions Type casting in expressions can be used to explicitly convert data from one type to another. This technique is particularly useful in situations where operations between different data types are necessary. For example, casting an integer to a float in a division operation to obtain a floating-point result. However, it\u0026rsquo;s important to use type casting judiciously to maintain the precision and integrity of data.\nThe Significance of Expression Evaluation Order While operator precedence and associativity rules dictate the order of operations in an expression, the sequence in which expressions are evaluated can also be influenced by function calls, side effects, and sequence points. Understanding how C++ evaluates expressions, especially in complex statements, is essential for debugging and writing predictable code.\nCompiler Optimizations and Expressions Modern C++ compilers often optimize expressions to enhance performance. These optimizations might include reordering operations (while respecting the language rules), eliminating redundant calculations, or simplifying expressions at compile time. Being aware of these potential optimizations can help in writing more efficient code and understanding any discrepancies between the written code and its execution behaviour.\nBest Practices for Writing Expressions To maintain readability and reduce errors in C++, it\u0026rsquo;s advisable to write clear and simple expressions. Avoid overly complex expressions, use parentheses to clarify order of operations, and follow coding standards and guidelines. Readable expressions are easier to debug, maintain, and understand, especially in collaborative environments.\nAdding these paragraphs can provide a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of expressions in C++, catering to both beginners and experienced programmers.\nReferences  C Operator Precedence - https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/operator_precedence#cite_note-1  Citation  For attribution, please cite this work as:  Oliveira T.P.

Wouldn’t it be great if we had a method to accurately predict the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases we’ll have every single day for, say, the next month? If we could do that, we’d know whether our measures to contain the virus are working, whether we would be able to lift particular restrictions here and there, invest in intensive care units, or whether that wedding we had planned long ago would finally happen or have to be postponed… again.\nIt is very hard, however, to pinpoint exactly every single factor that affects the number of reported COVID-19 cases, and most importantly, measure them all. Here we try and outline different techniques we could use to try and predict how the outbreak will behave in the future, and show a particular method we have developed to obtain short-term forecasts with a reasonable degree of accuracy. We have packaged the method into an app, which you can access here.\n\rWhat strategies can we use?\rThere are many different strategies and mathematical/statistical tools we can use to attempt to predict the future. These can include what we call mechanistic, or compartment models, for example. These make assumptions based on empirical evidence of the biological system being studied and translate them into mathematical equations based on the flow of individuals to/from specific compartments. For COVID-19 the SEIR-type model has been widely used by many research groups to describe the behaviour of the outbreak (see our blog post on the use of SEIR models to predict when the pandemic will end). They are realistic in the sense that they reflect the epidemiological behaviour of the outbreak.\nThere are other alternatives that do not take into account the true biological nature of the phenomenon per se, but may use it as input in a different way. Many machine learning techniques could sometimes be seen as black-box methods, that would e.g. take the reported number of past COVID-19 cases and other variables that we would believe could influence this number and spit out a prediction for tomorrow, or next week, next month, etc. There are cases where these methods are even more accurate than mechanistic models, however there is a trade-off to consider here in terms of prediction accuracy vs. explainability, as discussed here. If a new event or variable comes into play, which could empirically be very important to dictate the future behaviour of the pandemic, it is very difficult to gauge its effects using a black-box method.\nWe could also simply assume that the number of reported COVID-19 cases today is purely a reflection of the reported number of cases yesterday, and the day before, and so on. So we pretty much assume all variables that influence this process can be summarised purely by the outcomes we have observed in the past, and this can in turn be used to forecast what future numbers will be. Of course, there are plenty of different ways to include other variables in these types of models, but the important thing is to notice that we place a very heavy assumption on an underlying process that is able to explain its own behaviour. We usually refer to these models as “time series” or “state-space” models.\n\rWhy is it so difficult?\rThere are many factors that influence our ability to predict the number of future COVID-19 cases. Imagine we have, for example, a fantastic SEIR-type model that can reproduce the dynamics of the disease almost perfectly up to today. To be able to predict with great accuracy what will happen tomorrow (or even further down the line), we must assume, among other things, that the assumptions that hold today will still hold tomorrow and so on. If any new variable comes into play, or if the variables that are involved change over time, our predictions can be completely off.\nThis is not the worst problem, however. There are in fact many variables that we’re simply not able to measure with good precision. This includes knowing, for example, where everybody in the country is at all times, who they talk to, for how long, where they will be, etc. This is why it is important to do contact tracing, although this matters mostly in a retrospective way, not necessarily to predict what will happen in the future.\nBut wait a minute now, we don’t even know whether the data we can actually measure is in fact accurate! Or to be more specific, we do know that our data is definitely not 100% accurate. Cases reported today could reflect infections that happened between a few days ago to several weeks. Tests are not 100% accurate either, so there is a pool of false positives in there, as well as false negatives not being included in the whole sum. Simply put, the data we have is pretty much a proxy of the real thing. Hence why it is so important to understand what these numbers could actually mean, and not imbue them with improper meaning.\n\rWhat about short-term forecasting?\rSo long-term forecasting is very prone to built-up variation and error, as we all know. It’s just like predicting what time you’ll wake up on your birthday 10 years from now. But there must be something we could do in the short-term, right? Well, it depends on how “long” this short-term is. And it also depends on how we want to use this information.\nWe developed a modelling framework in an attempt to predict the number of reported COVID-19 cases for up to 7 days in the future. We fitted our models to the data collected by the ECDC to generate the forecasts. See below for a validation study we carried out back in May/2020.\nThe panels are in the logarithmic scale, but in essence, the closer the points are to the identity line (dashed line), the closer our model was in predicting the number of COVID-19 cases up to 7 days ahead (panels in part A). In part B we see that the accuracy of the method is high for all 7 days ahead, but we begin to lose in terms of precision from day four onwards. (\\(r\\) represents Pearson’s linear correlation coefficient, the closest it is to 1 the better the method is; the same applies to the CCC - the concordance correlation coefficient.)\nThe idea behind this is not to be able to inform governments the exact numbers we’d expect tomorrow, but to give more perspective in terms of the types of trends we expect in the near future. This is useful to inform decision making related to the healthcare services. For instance, if a particular country’s healthcare system is currently at capacity, and we are predicting an upward trend in the number of infections, then this could guide policy in terms of resource allocation to accommodate the extra patients that are likely to seek health professionals in the upcoming weeks. This is why it is so important to look at overall trends (for example, the number of cases per 100,000 people over the last 14 days).\nOur model creates predictions based on two components. The first, called the autoregressive component, uses information on the past number of cases to predict future ones. The second is included to account for extra variability that could occur for a variety of different reasons. The autoregressive component is directly linked to the behaviour of the outbreak, so it is useful to detect waves of the pandemic. See, for example, our latest estimates for Ireland:\nWe can clearly see that towards the end of July this second wave was already starting to take shape, and now we are aiming at a new peak of cases.\n\rGrouping countries together\rNow that we have profiles for each country on how the pandemic is behaving in terms of number of cases, perhaps it would be a good idea to look at which countries present a similar behaviour over the last, say, 60 days. We created a dendrogram based on a cluster analysis performed using the values of the autoregressive parameter and produced the figure below –\nHere we see that over looking at the past two months, the country that has presented the most similar behaviour to Ireland was Croatia. In our app you can play with different ways of presenting the dendrogram, as well as print names of different countries in bold to aid in finding them easily when looking at the picture. You can also change the number of clusters.\nPerhaps these comparisons would be useful in terms of comparing government policies on how to deal with the COVID-19 outbreak, and learn lessons from successful policies vs unsuccessful ones. Also, this type of modelling can help to detect a further wave of the outbreak sooner rather than when we are already in the middle of it!\n\rAll models are wrong…\rIn the end of the day, there is no true, correct model we can apply. After all, it is impossible to know exactly what the data generating mechanism is. We can only attempt to understand it and reproduce its behaviour using mathematical/statistical tools. We hope, however, that our modelling approach can be useful. We could point a whole list of problems with it here, such as completely ignoring biological mechanisms and using just past behaviour to explain future behaviour without any additional context. But we believe it represents a reasonable attempt at forecasting the number of COVID-19 cases in the short-term.\nDid you find this page helpful?

There are several variable\u0026rsquo;s type in C, and here we are introducing the type int, which is used for integer data types. Basically, we can define a variable as an integer in two ways:\n* Uninitialized variable: defined as `int x;`, where no value is assign to the variable $x$ (Figure 1), which generally is not a good idea as it could lead to a bug in the algorithm if no value is assign over the code. * Initialized variable: there are two ways to assign a value to a variable $x$ (Figure 1):\r* in a single declaration - `int x = 3;`\r* in a double step declaration - `int x;` and `x = 3;`\r\r\rDeclaring variables in C\n\rAdditionally, there are a large set of storage size-specific declarations for a integer, and here we will explain just an initial idea about it. Figure 2 showns the Integer representation of whole numbers or fixed-point numbers (fixed number of digits). Generally, computers use a fixed number of bits to represent them, where commonly used bit-lengths for integers are 8-bit, 16-bit (short), 32-bit (long) or 64-bit (long long). There are two representation schemes for integers called signed integer type (signed int) capable of containing the range of values from -32,767 to 32,767, and unsigned integer type (unsigned int) containing the range of values from 0 to 65,535 ($32767 \\times 2+1$). Therefore, unsigned qualifier should be used when we are working with only positive values.\nInteger Representation\n\rFurthermore, there are three representation schemes for signed integers called Sign-Magnitude representation, 1\u0026rsquo;s Complement representation, and 2\u0026rsquo;s Complement representation. The 1’s and the 2’s complements of a binary number are important because they permit different representation for negative numbers. In all of these schemes, positive signed binary numbers starts with value 0 while negative ones starts with value 1 (Figure 3).\nSigned binary numbers\n\rConsequently, the disadvantage of signed binary numbers is that there is 1 bit used to store the sign positive or negative while the remaning $n-1$ bits are assign to the range of digits from $-2^{n-1}$ to $2^{n-1}$. If we have 8 bits to represent a signed binary number, we have to use 1 bit for the **sign bit** and 7 bits for the **magnitude bits**:\r* Using Sign-Magnitude Representation:\r$$-|2^{\\left(8-1\\right)}-1| \\mbox{ to } 2^{\\left(8-1\\right)}-1 = -127 \\mbox{ to } 127$$\r* Using 2's Complement Representation:\r$$-2^{\\left(8-1\\right)} \\mbox{ to } 2^{\\left(8-1\\right)}-1 = -128 \\mbox{ to } 127$$\r\rThus, we can representing the numbers ranging from -128 to 127 using 2's Complement Representation. Probably now you are asking why there is one extra number being accounted when using 2's Complement Representation. The answer can be found in the Figure 4.\rRepresentation schemes of Sign-Magnitude Representation and 2's Complement Representation\n\rExamples Unsigned int Supose we are interested in representing a sequence of number $x$ where $x \\in \\lbrace 0, 1, \\ldots, 15\\rbrace$. We can assign these numbers as unsigned numbers of 4 bits. Consequently, we have 4 zero bits associated to describe this numbers because our variable belongs to the interval $[0, 2^{4}−1] \\in \\mathcal{N}_{0}$.\nRepresentation of numbers from 0 to 15 in 4 bits\r\r\rbits \r0000 \r0001 \r0010 \r0011 \r0100 \r0101 \r0110 \r0111 \r1000 \r1001 \r1010 \r1011 \r1100 \r1101 \r1110 \r1111 \r\r\rx \r0 \r1 \r2 \r3 \r4 \r5 \r6 \r7 \r8 \r9 \r10 \r11 \r12 \r13 \r14 \r15 \r\r\r\rSigned int Supose now we are interested in representing a sequence of number $y$ where $y \\in \\lbrace -7, -6, \\ldots,6, 7\\rbrace$.

Let \\(E[y]\\) represent the expected value of \\(y\\), defined as:\n\\[E[y]=10-0.5x_1+0.6x_1^2-0.6x_2+0.2x_2^2+0.1x_1x_2\\]\rWe can manually compute the total fat \\(y\\) for specific values of \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\). For instance, if \\(x_1=2\\) and \\(x_2=1\\), then:\n\\[y=10-0.5\\times2+0.6\\times 2^2-0.6\\times 1+0.2 \\times 1^2+0.1\\times 2 \\times 1 = 11.2.\\]\nNow, let’s assume the secondary goal is to optimize the fat content in the ice cream formulation based on this model. This involves searching for the global minimum on the response surface. Consequently, we can break down our project into two tasks:\nGeneralize the function for any \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\);\rCalculate the global (or absolute) minimum point;\r\r\rIf you encounter difficulties in these tasks, it’s often due to a gap in specific domain knowledge, such as a lack of expertise in mathematics:\n\rHow could I calculate the global minimum?\rHow can I use partial derivatives?\r\r\rTherefore, during this step, it is essential to identify all the necessary domain knowledge and address these gaps before proceeding to the next stage. Sometimes, this knowledge may stem from specialized areas such as computer science, sports, agriculture, statistics, or engineering.\n\r\rStep 2 - Write everything you did\rIn this phase, it is crucial to meticulously record every action undertaken to resolve the project’s challenges or tasks. Ensure that your notes are clear and detailed enough for others to replicate your solutions effortlessly. Be cautious not to overlook steps that might seem obvious, such as basic operations like multiplying \\(x\\) by \\(y\\), or the sequence in which tasks are to be executed.\nExample 2\rConsider the task of calculating \\(f(x, y) = x^y + 3x\\) for \\(x=2\\) and \\(y=4\\). Here’s how you could document the process in a detailed and comprehensible manner:\n\rMultiply 2 by 2 \\(\\rightarrow\\) you get 4\rMultiply 4 by 2 \\(\\rightarrow\\) you get 8\rMultiply 8 by 2 \\(\\rightarrow\\) you get 16\rSum 16 plus 3 multiplied by 2 \\(\\rightarrow\\) you get 22\r22 is the answer.\r\r\rBy following these explicit steps, anyone with basic mathematical skills should be able to reach the same result.\n\r\rStep 3 - Generalize\rThe goal now is to transform the specific steps from earlier into a universal algorithm that applies to a broader range of cases, not just specific parameter values. Here are two common methods to achieve this generalization:\n\rRe-examine the details from Step 2, as the key to generalization often lies within its description.\rIdentify repetitive patterns, particularly where the same step is executed multiple times.\r\r\rFor instance, let’s generalize our Example 2 by adapting the steps from Step 2, replacing the specific occurrences of 2 with a variable \\(x\\):\n\rMultiply 2 by \\(x\\) \\(\\rightarrow\\) you get 4\rMultiply 4 by \\(x\\) \\(\\rightarrow\\) you get 8\rMultiply 8 by \\(x\\) \\(\\rightarrow\\) you get 16\rSum 16 plus 3 multiplied by \\(x\\) \\(\\rightarrow\\) you get 22\r22 is the answer.\r\r\rIt is important to note that the initial multiplication should start with \\(x \\times x = x^2\\). Therefore, we multiply \\(x\\) by itself \\(y-1\\) times to obtain \\(x^y\\). This leads us to the following generalized steps for any values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\):\nAlgorithm sketch 1\rstart with x = 2 and y = 4\rn[1] = x\rCount up from i in 1 to y-1 n[i+1] = n[i] * x z = n[y] + 3 * x\rz is the answer\rThis process is referred to as writing ‘pseudo-code’ as an algorithm design with no particular target language.\n\r\rStep 4 - Test Your Algorithm\rTesting your algorithm is a crucial step to ensure the correctness of steps 1-3 before advancing to step 5. Here are some key actions and considerations during this stage:\n\rTest your algorithm with varying parameter values.\rAssess the algorithm’s behavior for positive, negative, or zero values.\rDetermine if you have confined the parameter space, e.g., \\(y \\geq 0\\).\rEmploy mathematical proofs to validate your approach.\rRecognize that there may be more than one correct solution to a programming problem.\r\r\rRemember, the parameter space refers to the range of possible parameter values that define a specific mathematical or statistical model, typically within a subset of the finite-dimensional Euclidean space.\n\rAt times, the generalization in step 3 might be incomplete, leading to a revisit of steps 1-2. This oversight often occurs when not all potential cases are considered or when mathematical proofs are lacking.\nA notable example of an algorithmic error is seen in Example 2. What if \\(y=0\\) or \\(y\u0026lt;0\\)? Our algorithm incorrectly addresses these cases. For example, with \\(x=2\\) and \\(y=0\\), the algorithm erroneously calculates \\(2^0=2\\) instead of the correct \\(2^0=1\\). Also, for any \\(y \\leq 0\\), the algorithm erroneously tries to count from \\(1\\) to \\(y-1 \u0026lt; 0\\), which is not applicable for natural numbers, leading to an error. Therefore, we must ensure \\(|y| \\in \\mathcal{N}_{0}\\), where \\(\\mathcal{N}_{0}\\) represents the set of natural numbers including zero. Consequently, we should aim to generalize our algorithm to accommodate a broader range of cases:\nAlgorithm Sketch 2 y must be an integer number.\rStart with x = 2 and y = 4.\rIf y=0 {\rn[1] = 1;\ri=0;\r} else {\rCount from i = 1 to |y|-1;\rIf y \u0026lt; 0 {\rn[1] = 1/x;\rn[i+1] = n[i] * (1/x);\r} else {\rn[1] = x;\rn[i+1] = n[i] * x;\r}\r}\rz = n[i+1] + 3 * x;\rz is the answer.\rQuestion: How can we improve this algorithm? Consider the case where \\(x=y=0\\).\n\rWhen encountering problems with our algorithm at this stage, we have two options:\nReturn to steps 1-3 to gather more information for broadening the algorithm’s applicability.\rDirectly fix the algorithm in step 4 when the solution is known.\r\r\rExample 3\rThe data in Figure 4 originates from an algorithm that accepts a single parameter, \\(N\\), belonging to the set \\(\\mathcal{N}_{0}\\), where \\(\\mathcal{N}_{0} = \\mathcal{N} \\cup \\{ 0 \\}\\) denotes the set of natural numbers including zero. This algorithm generates a sequence of output values corresponding to each specified value of \\(N\\).\n\rFigure 3: Output of sequences of integers based on values of \\(N\\) from 0 to 4\r\rQuestion: Can you deduce the algorithm that produced the numbers in this figure? Additionally, what would be the result for \\(N=5\\)?\n\r\r\rReferences\r[1] Hilton, AD; Lipp, GM; Rodger, SH, Translation from Problem to Code in Seven Steps, Comped 2019 Proceedings of the Acm Conference on Global Computing Education (2019), pp. 78-84.\n\rAnswers\rExample 3\rAlgorithm Sketch 3\rSet N as a non-negative integer (Natural number with zero).\rInitialize N with a specific value n.\rDefine the sequence parameters:\rMinimum Value = 4 * N\rMaximum Value = 9 * N + 6\rSequence Increment = 3\rSet x[1] to the Minimum Value.\rIteratively calculate the sequence:\rFor each iteration i,\rif x[i-1] \u0026lt; Maximum Value,\rthen x[i] = x[i-1] + Sequence Increment.\relse,\rbreak the loop.\rThe sequence x represents the final answer.\r# N = 6\rN=5\rseq \u0026lt;- seq(4*N, 9*N+6, 3)\rcat(\u0026quot;The answer is\u0026quot;, seq)\r## The answer is 20 23 26 29 32 35 38 41 44 47 50\r\r\rCitation\rFor attribution, please cite this work as:\r\rOliveira T.P.

Quantifying the drives of genetic change in such programmes is challenging. Traditionally we measure the genetic change with a phenotypic or genetic trend, but these measures only change the overall genetic mean. To understand the genetic change more comprehensively, we also need to measure the change in genetic variance and drives of mean and variance changes. To quantify the drives of genetic change in mean we can i) partition breeding values into parent average and Mendelian sampling terms, ii) allocate the terms to analyst-defined \"paths\" (specific individuals or groups of individuals), and iii) summarise the path specific terms to quantify path contributions to the overall genetic trend in mean.

Such individualisation is possible if cycle length can be predicted to a highdegree of accuracy. To achieve this, a hybrid predictive model was built using data on 16,990 cycles collected from a sampleof 2,178 women (mean age 33.89 years, range 14.98 - 47.10, number of menstrual cycles ranging from 4 - 53). To capture thewithin-subject temporal correlation, a mixed-effect state-space model was fitted incorporating a Bayesian approach for processforecasting to predict the duration (in days) of the next menstrual cycle. The modelling procedure was split into three steps(i)a time trend component using a random walk with an overdispersion parameter, (ii) an autocorrelation component using anautoregressive moving-average (ARMA) model, and (iii) a linear predictor to account for covariates (e.g. injury, stomach cramps,training intensity). The inclusion of an overdispersion parameter suggested that26.81% [24.14%,29.58%]of cycles in the samplewere overdispersed where the random walk standard deviation under a non-overdispersed cycle is1.0530 [1.0060,1.0526]days whileunder an overdispersed cycle it increased to4.7386 [4.5379,4.9492]days. To assess the performance and prediction accuracy ofthe model, each woman’s last observation was used as test data. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Concordance CorrelationCoefficient (CCC) and Pearson correlation coefficient (r) between the observed and predicted values were calculated. The modelhad an RMSE of 1.6126 days, a precision of 0.7501 and overall accuracy of 0.9855.
