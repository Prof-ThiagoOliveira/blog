As a PhD candidate, I was a visiting Scholar at the National University of Ireland in 2016, working with statistical modelling for agricultural data. Besides, I was a lecturer in the Department of Exact Sciences at ESALQ/University of São Paulo, Piracicaba, São Paulo, Brazil from 2017 to 2019. I worked as a Researcher Biostatistician from 2019-2020 at Insight Centre for Data Analytics in partnership with Orreco, School of Mathematics, Statistics, and Applied Mathematics, and NUI Galway in the development of statistical methods applied to athlete performance, and predictive models for COVID-19. I developed statistical methods in longitudinal concordance correlation, multilevel model (hierarchical model), generalized linear mixed-effects model, state-space models, experimental design, longitudinal data. As an enthusiast of the usage of dashboard apps to create an interactive data visualization, I believe that interactive applications are an easier way to create visual representations of large scale data sets, allowing the user explore the complex reality of the database, or even handle multiple sets of data in a single visualization. Recently, I was awarded a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Individual Fellowship to work at The Roslin Institute - The University of Edinburgh, where I currently work on the development of statistical models applied to quantitative genetics and genomics of plant breeding in partnership with Limagrain.

We show that our model generates highly accurate forecasts up to six days ahead, and use estimated model components to cluster countries based on recent events. We introduce statistical novelty in terms of modelling the autoregressive parameter as a function of time, increasing predictive power and flexibility to adapt to each country. Our model can also be used to forecast the number of deaths, study the effects of covariates (such as lockdown policies), and generate forecasts for smaller regions within countries. Consequently, it has strong implications for global planning and decision making. We constantly update forecasts and make all results freely available to any country in the world through an online Shiny dashboard.\n","date":1605178800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1605178800,"objectID":"d21c73970b60035164ac402b09400a5c","permalink":"https://prof-thiagooliveira.netlify.com/talk/2020-young-isa/","publishdate":"2020-11-10T12:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2020-young-isa/","section":"talk","summary":"Accurate short-term forecasting is thus vital to support country-level policy making during COVID-19 outbreak","tags":["COVID-19","Outbreak","State-Space Model","Longitudinal Data"],"title":"Global Short-Term Forecasting of Covid-19 Cases","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Heloisa Thomazi Kleina1","Karla Kudlawiec","Mariana B.

Such individualisation is possible if cycle length can be predicted to a highdegree of accuracy. To achieve this, a hybrid predictive model was built using data on 16,990 cycles collected from a sampleof 2,178 women (mean age 33.89 years, range 14.98 - 47.10, number of menstrual cycles ranging from 4 - 53). To capture thewithin-subject temporal correlation, a mixed-effect state-space model was fitted incorporating a Bayesian approach for processforecasting to predict the duration (in days) of the next menstrual cycle. The modelling procedure was split into three steps(i)a time trend component using a random walk with an overdispersion parameter, (ii) an autocorrelation component using anautoregressive moving-average (ARMA) model, and (iii) a linear predictor to account for covariates (e.g. injury, stomach cramps,training intensity). The inclusion of an overdispersion parameter suggested that26.81% [24.14%,29.58%]of cycles in the samplewere overdispersed where the random walk standard deviation under a non-overdispersed cycle is1.0530 [1.0060,1.0526]days whileunder an overdispersed cycle it increased to4.7386 [4.5379,4.9492]days. To assess the performance and prediction accuracy ofthe model, each woman’s last observation was used as test data. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Concordance CorrelationCoefficient (CCC) and Pearson correlation coefficient (r) between the observed and predicted values were calculated. The modelhad an RMSE of 1.6126 days, a precision of 0.7501 and overall accuracy of 0.9855. In the absence of hormonal measurements,knowing how aspects of physiology and psychology are changing across the menstrual cycle has the potential to help femaleathletes personalise their training, nutrition and recovery tailored to their cycle to sustain peak performance at the highest leveland gain a competitive edge. In conclusion, the hybrid model presented here is a useful approach for predicting menstrual cyclelength which in turn can be used to support female athlete wellness to optimise performance ","date":1570179600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1570179600,"objectID":"14574e4e871fb3b9efd44ac2882f66ed","permalink":"https://prof-thiagooliveira.netlify.com/talk/2019-young-stats/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2019-young-stats/","section":"talk","summary":"Times are changing.

The main features of the package are the estimation and inference of the extent of agreement using numerical and graphical summaries. Moreover, our approach presents flexibility in the sense that it accommodates both balanced and unbalanced experimental designs, allows for different within-group error structures, while also allowing for the inclusion of covariates in the linear predictor to control systematic variations in the response.
