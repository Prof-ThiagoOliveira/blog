      <title>Genomic strategies for optimal crossbreeding in African dairy cattle</title>
      <link>https://prof-thiagooliveira.netlify.com/project/ihouaga_adgg_spatial/</link>

      <description>&lt;p align=&#34;justify&#34;&gt;
This project will develop genomic strategies to optimise crossbreeding in livestock breeding programmes with focus on East African crossbred dairy cattle. Crossbreeding is the mating of individuals from different lines, breeds, or populations. There are three benefits of crossbreeding in livestock:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cross-bred animals perform better than purebreds because of breed complementary,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p align=&#34;justify&#34;&gt; Cross-bred animals perform better than purebreds because of heterosis (hybrid vigour), and &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p align=&#34;justify&#34;&gt; Cross-breeding protects breeders&#39; intellectual property because production animals outperform their offspring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p align=&#34;justify&#34;&gt;
Breed complementary refers to the fact that a cross between breeds with different strengths has the potential to combine the strengths of its parents. In the East African dairy sector, which provides the context for this project, the goal is to develop a cross in cattle that combines the milk production of the Holstein with the tropical adaptation of the East African Zebu. Hybrid vigour is the tendency of a cross-bred animal to outperform its purebred parents. Cross-breeding protects the breeders&#39; intellectual property because cross-bred production animals outperform their offspring, so farmers get better returns by buying production animals from the breeder than by breeding from production animals. An analogous example of the benefits of cross-breeding in the crop breeding practice is seen in maize which has seen a 6-fold increase in productivity since hybrid breeding was introduced in the 1930s.

      <title>AlphaPart - Partition of Breeding Values by Paths of Information</title>
      <link>https://prof-thiagooliveira.netlify.com/project/alphapart-project/</link>

      <guid>https://prof-thiagooliveira.netlify.com/project/alphapart-project/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p align=&#34;justify&#34;&gt;
The partitioning method is described in Garcia-Cortes et al. (2008). The package includes the main function AlphaPart for partitioning breeding values and auxiliary functions for manipulating data and summarizing, visualizing, and saving results.

      <title>Statistical models applied to quantitative genetics and genomics of plant breeding</title>
      <link>https://prof-thiagooliveira.netlify.com/project/genetic-project/</link>

      <description>&lt;p align=&#34;justify&#34;&gt;
Plant breeding programmes are a complex network of a multitude of operations and decisions. Quantifying the drives of genetic change in such programmes is challenging. Traditionally we measure the genetic change with a phenotypic or genetic trend, but these measures only change the overall genetic mean. To understand the genetic change more comprehensively, we also need to measure the change in genetic variance and drives of mean and variance changes. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&#34;justify&#34;&gt;
To quantify the drives of genetic change in mean we can i) partition breeding values into parent average and Mendelian sampling terms, ii) allocate the terms to analyst-defined &#34;paths&#34; (specific individuals or groups of individuals), and iii) summarise the path specific terms to quantify path contributions to the overall genetic trend in mean. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have used the partitioning method in several cases with profound results:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p align=&#34;justify&#34;&gt; To estimate the contribution of different cattle breeding programmes globally and in particular countries; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To estimate the contribution of national selection and import in cattle; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To evaluate national selection and import in pig breeds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p align=&#34;justify&#34;&gt;
This project aims to apply the partitioning method to plant breeding programmes and to expand its versatility. Specifically, we are aiming to:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p align=&#34;justify&#34;&gt; Utilise genomic information to identify which genome regions drive genetic change and which sources contribute to favourable alleles in these genome regions &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analyse changes in genetic variance in addition to the genetic mean&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Account for uncertainty in genetic trends and their partitions, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop an R package&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
